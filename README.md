👋 Hello, I'm @wasabikev!

👀 I'm thinking too much about Large Language Models (LLMs) with a specific focus on their operations and the *wide* range of applications. "The Cambrian Explosion of AI."

🌱 I'm presently working on AI ∞ UI, an UI wrapper to interact with GPT and other LLMs and provide platform for broader orchestration.

💞️ I'm always open to collaborative opportunities, particularly those that involve innovative use of LLMs and AI. 

🌐 You can reach me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atkinsonkevin/)

🔮 **What's Next?** The core framework AI ∞ UI is complete.  Next, extending it to be a contextually aware code assistant.
