Building production AI platforms that solve real enterprise problems.

---

🛠️ **Current Focus:**  
Architecting multi-tenant LLM orchestration at [Asgard Systems AI](https://asgardsystems.ai/) - async task queues handling 20+ minute operations, composite PII detection (37+ entity types), and evidence-based RAG for financial compliance. Most work in private repos under separate GitHub account.

💡 **Technical Interests**  
- Python async patterns at scale (Quart, SQLAlchemy async, Redis queues)
- Multi-provider LLM routing with deterministic fallbacks
- Building compliant AI systems for regulated industries
- Eliminating hallucinations through evidence-based architectures

🚀 **Open Source Extracts** *(coming soon)*  
- `async-llm-orchestrator` - Pattern for long-running AI operations without timeouts
- `composite-pii-detector` - Multi-method framework for enterprise data protection
- `evidence-based-rag` - Citation requirements for trustworthy AI responses

📊 **Background**  
20+ years in enterprise technology. Previously Director of Technology at HKP Advisors, building secure systems for professional services. Deep expertise in Python async systems, distributed architectures, and turning compliance requirements into scalable solutions.
