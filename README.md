👋 Hello, I'm @wasabikev!

👀 I'm thinking too much about Large Language Models (LLMs) with a specific focus on their operations and the *wide* range of applications. "The Cambrian Explosion of AI."

🌱 I'm presently expanding my knowledge and skillset in Python, vector databases, and the emerging LLM App stack. So many areas to focus on.

💞️ I'm always open to collaborative opportunities, particularly those that involve innovative use of LLMs and AI. I'm eager to connect with others in the field and contribute to interesting and challenging projects.

🌐 You can reach me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atkinsonkevin/)

🔮 **What's Next?** I want to fine-tune one... and I'd love to secure some compute to pre-train one.
